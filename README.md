# GodotPortfolio
Small platformer made with the Godot Engine. Continuity of my Unity_Platformer.

I got an intern job following my experimentations with Unity. I now work with this game engine on a daily basis.
I decided to stop developping this project to use Godot, an engine I think is better suited for a small, 2D project.
It will be part of my portfolio if it is polished enough.
